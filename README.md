InfinityOS is a Distribution based on the latest version of Ubuntu, however, Debian Repositories have been added for a wide range of programs to be installed.
Currently this OS is in a Closed Pre-Alpha stage, these very early versions will be released to the public after the First Stable Version is released.
This OS will follow a Half Yearly update cycle, having a large update every 6 months. 
There will be no LTS Versions for the forseeable future.
The Naming Scheme for these versions will follow the current Solar System, If names run out, Moons will also be included.
For Example, The current Pre-Alpha version is "InfinityOS v0.0.1 Sun", it will stay as version "Sun" until the first stable release, it will then move to "InfinityOS v1.0 Mercury".
